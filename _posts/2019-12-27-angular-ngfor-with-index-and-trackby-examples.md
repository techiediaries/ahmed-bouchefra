In this post, we'll see by examples how to use the `ngFor` directive to iterate over arrays of data and even objects in Angular templates.


Angular makes use of HTML for templates associated with components which eventually represent the views of your front-end application. 

A component controls a part of your application user interface and the associated template is what's get rendered in that part of the UI.

Since HTML doesn't have a built-in template language, Angular extends HTML with a powerful template syntax that includes many directives such as `ngFor` which is similar to typical for loops in programming languages.

The `ngFor` allows to loop through an array of data directly in the HTML template. The array must be present in the associated component.
